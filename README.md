# Hello-world
Hello,
My name is Maryam Heidari. I recently acquired my MS degree in Data Analytics at Northeastern University. I also have MBA degree and BS degree in Chemical Engineering.

As a holder MBA degree in addition to Master of Data Analytics, I possess fluency in the languages of both business and technology. I bring to the table a unique capacity to translate raw data into user-friendly platforms that can be utilized to make data driven decisions and strategy plan. I always feel the gap between end-user (customer), and stockholders with the technical team, because they have different terms to describe that they are looking for.

I made my Github profile when I started my MS degree in Data Analytics and try to share sample of my work and coding in there.

I hope you enjoy it and help me to improve my skills more and more
Thank you

Best Regards, Maryam
